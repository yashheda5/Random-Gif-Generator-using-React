# GIF Generator React App

Welcome to the GIF Generator React App! This project is a React application that fetches and displays random GIFs from Giphy. Users can input a tag and click "Generate" to retrieve a GIF related to that tag. The app includes a loading spinner for better UX and supports both random and tag-based GIF searches. Built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, this project is a great way to learn or enhance your skills in React, API integration, and state management.
